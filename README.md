This library provides a family of [concepts](#concepts) for
managing
[state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)#Program_state)
with [Kefir](http://rpominov.github.io/kefir/).

Use of state and mutation is often considered error-prone and rightly so.
Stateful concepts are *inherently difficult*, because, unlike stateless
concepts, they include the concept of time: *state changes over time*.  When
state changes, computations based on state, including copies of state, may
become invalid or inconsistent.

Using this library:

* You can **_store_** state in *first-class* objects
  called [Atom](#class-Atom)s.
  * *This means that you can avoid copying or duplicating state to share it
    across components of your program.  You simply share references to the
    state.*

* You can define **_decomposed_** *first-class* views of state
  using [lens](#lens)es.
  * *This means that when a component of your program is only interested in a
    part of state you can make it so that the module does not need to know about
    the rest of the state.*

* You can define **_composed_** *first-class* views of state
  as [Molecule](#class-Molecule)s.
  * *This means that when a component of your program is interested in parts of
    state that are stored separately you can make it so that the module does not
    need to know that.*

* You get **_consistent_** access to state using [get](#get)
  and [modify](#modify) operations at any point and through all views.
  * *This means that by using views, both decomposed and composed, of state you
    can avoid copying state and inconsistency problems associated with that.*

* You can express arbitrary **_dependent computations_** using observable
  combinators from [Kefir](http://rpominov.github.io/kefir/)
  as [AbstractMutable](#class-AbstractMutable)s are
  also
  [Kefir](http://rpominov.github.io/kefir/) [properties](http://rpominov.github.io/kefir/#about-observables).
  * *This means that you can make it so that computations dependent upon state
    remain consistent even when state changes over time.*

* You can mutate state through multiple views and multiple
  atomic [modify](#modify) operations in a **_transactional_** manner
  by [holding](#holding) event propagation from state changes.
  * *This means that you can avoid glitches and computing unnecessary
    intermediate states.*

The rest of this README provides a brief description of the
main [concepts](#concepts) of this library and a [reference](#reference).

The above diagram illustrates the subtype relationships between the basic
concepts

* **Observable**,
* **Stream**, and
* **Property**

of [Kefir](http://rpominov.github.io/kefir/#about-observables) and the concepts
added by this library

* **AbstractMutable**,
* **Atom**,
* **LensedAtom**, and
* **Molecule**.

## Reference

Typically one only uses the default export

```js
import Atom from "kefir.atom"
```

of this library.  It provides a convenience function that constructs a `new`
instance of the [`Atom`](#class-Atom) class.

The classes [`AbstractMutable`](#class-AbstractMutable), [`Atom`](#class-Atom),
[`LensedAtom`](#class-LensedAtom) and [`Molecule`](#class-Molecule) are also
provided as named exports:

```js
import {AbstractMutable, Atom, LensedAtom, Molecule} from "kefir.atom"
```

Note that the [default export](#Atom) is not the same as the named
export [`Atom`](#class-Atom).

There are use cases where you would want to create new subtypes of
[`AbstractMutable`](#class-AbstractMutable), but it seems unlikely that you
should inherit from the other classes.

### <a name="class-AbstractMutable"></a>[`AbstractMutable a :> Property a`](#class-AbstractMutable)

`AbstractMutable` is the abstract base class or interface against which most
code using atoms is actually written.  An `AbstractMutable` is a
Kefir [property](http://rpominov.github.io/kefir/#about-observables) that also
provides for ability to request to [`modify`](#modify) the value of the
property.  `AbstractMutable`s implicitly skip duplicates using
Ramda's [`equals`](http://ramdajs.com/0.21.0/docs/#equals) function.

Note that we often abuse terminology and speak of [`Atom`](#class-Atom)s when we
should speak of `AbstractMutable`s, because [`Atom`](#class-Atom) is easier to
pronounce and is more concrete.

### <a name="class-Atom"></a>[`Atom a :> AbstractMutable a`](#class-Atom)

An `Atom` is a simple implementation of
an [`AbstractMutable`](#class-AbstractMutable) that actually stores state.  One
can create an `Atom` directly by explicitly giving an initial value or one can
create an `Atom` without an initial value.

The *value* stored by an `Atom` *must* be treated as an *immutable* object.
Instead of mutating the value stored by an `Atom`, one mutates the `Atom` by
calling [`modify`](#modify), which makes the `Atom` to refer to the new value.

Note that `Atom` is not the only possible root implementation
of [`AbstractMutable`](#class-AbstractMutable).  For example, it would be
possible to implement an [`AbstractMutable`](#class-AbstractMutable) whose state
is actually stored in an external database that can be observed and mutated by
multiple clients.

### <a name="class-LensedAtom"></a>[`LensedAtom a :> AbstractMutable a`](#class-LensedAtom)

A `LensedAtom` is an implementation of
an [`AbstractMutable`](#class-AbstractMutable) that doesn't actually store
state, but instead refers to a part, specified using
a [lens](https://github.com/calmm-js/partial.lenses/), of
another [`AbstractMutable`](#class-AbstractMutable).  One creates `LensedAtom`s
by calling the [`lens`](#lens) method of
an [`AbstractMutable`](#class-AbstractMutable).

### <a name="class-Molecule"></a>[`Molecule t :> AbstractMutable (t where AbstractMutable x := x)`](#class-Molecule)

A `Molecule` is a special *partial* implementation of
an [`AbstractMutable`](#class-AbstractMutable) that is constructed from a
template of abstract mutables:

```js
const xyA = Atom({x: 1, y: 2})
const xL = xyA.lens("x")
const yL = xyA.lens("y")
const xyM = new Molecule({x: xL, y: yL})
```

When read, either as a property or via [`get`](#get), the abstract mutables in
the template are replaced by their values:

```js
R.equals( xyM.get(), xyA.get() )
// true
```

When written to, the abstract mutables in the template are written to with
matching elements from the written value:

```js
xyM.lens("x").set(3)
xL.get()
// 3
yL.get()
// 2
```

The writes are performed [`holding`](#holding) event propagation.

It is considered an error, and the effect is unpredictable, if the written value
does not match the template, aside from the positions of abstract mutables, of
course, which means that write operations, [`set`](#set), [`remove`](#remove)
and [`modify`](#modify), on `Molecule`s and lensed atoms created from molecules
are only *partial*.

Also, if the template contains multiple abstract mutables that correspond to the
same underlying state, then writing through the template will give unpredictable
results.

### <a name="Atom"></a>[`Atom(value)`](#Atom "Atom :: a -> Atom a")

Creates a new atom with the given initial value.

### <a name="Atom-empty"></a>[`Atom()`](#Atom-empty "Atom :: () -> Atom a")

Creates a new atom without an initial value.

### <a name="get"></a>[`atom.get()`](#get "get :: AbstractMutable a -> a")

Synchronously computes the current value of the atom.  Use of `get` is
discouraged: prefer to depend on an atom as you would with ordinary Kefir
properties.

When `get` is called on [`AbstractMutable`](#class-AbstractMutable) that has a
root [`Atom`](#class-Atom) that does not have a value, `get` returns the value
of those [`Atom`](#class-Atom)s as `undefined`.

### <a name="lens"></a>[`atom.lens(...ls)`](#lens "lens :: AbstractMutable a -> (...PLens a b) -> LensedAtom b")

Creates a new [`LensedAtom`](#class-LensedAtom) with the given path from the
original atom.  Modifications to the lensed atom are reflected in the original
atom and vice verse.

The lenses are treated as a path
of [partial lenses](https://github.com/calmm-js/partial.lenses/).  In fact, one
of the key ideas that makes lensed atoms possible is the compositionality of
partial lenses.  See the equations
here: [`L.compose`](https://github.com/calmm-js/partial.lenses#compose).  Those
equations make it possible not just to create lenses via composition (left hand
sides of equations), but also to create paths of lensed atoms (right hand sides
of equations).  More concretely, both the `c` in

```js
const b = a.lens(a_to_b_PLens)
const c = b.lens(b_to_c_PLens)
```

and in

```js
const c = a.lens(a_to_b_PLens, b_to_c_PLens)
```

can be considered equivalent thanks to the compositionality equations of lenses.

Note that, for most intents and purposes, `lens` is a referentially transparent
function: it does not create *new* mutable state&mdash;it merely creates a
reference to existing mutable state.

### <a name="modify"></a>[`atom.modify(currentValue => newValue)`](#modify "modify :: AbstractMutable a -> (a -> a) -> ()")

Conceptually applies the given function to the current value of the atom and
replaces the value of the atom with the new value returned by the function.
This is what happens with the basic [`Atom`](#class-Atom) implementation.  What
actually happens is decided by the implementation
of [`AbstractMutable`](#class-AbstractMutable) whose `modify` method is
ultimately called.

### <a name="set"></a>[`atom.set(value)`](#set "set :: AbstractMutable a -> a -> ()")

`atom.set(value)` is equivalent to [`atom.modify(() => value)`](#modify) and is
provided for convenience.

### <a name="remove"></a>[`atom.remove()`](#remove "remove :: AbstractMutable a -> ()")

`atom.remove()` is equivalent to [`atom.set()`](#set), which is also equivalent
to [`atom.set(undefined)`](#set), and is provided for convenience.  Calling
`remove` on a plain [`Atom`](#class-Atom) doesn't usually make sense, but
`remove` can be useful with [`LensedAtom`](#class-LensedAtom)s, where the
"removal" will then follow from the semantics
of [remove](https://github.com/calmm-js/partial.lenses#remove) on partial
lenses.

### <a name="view"></a>[`atom.view(...ls)`](#view "view :: AbstractMutable a -> (...PLens a b) -> Property b")

Creates a new view with the given path from the original atom.  Changes to the
original atom are reflected in the view.

### <a name="holding"></a>[`holding(() => ...)`](#holding "holding :: (() -> a) -> a")

There is also a named import `holding`

```js
import {holding} from "kefir.atom"
```

which is function that is given a thunk to call while holding the propagation of
events from changes to atoms.  The thunk
can [`get`](#get), [`set`](#set), [`remove`](#remove) and [`modify`](#modify)
any number of atoms.  After the thunk returns, persisting changes to atoms are
propagated.

Consider the following example:

```js
const xy = Atom({x: 1, y: 2})

const x = xy.lens("x")
const y = xy.lens("y")

x.log("x")
y.log("y")

holding(() => {
  xy.set({x: 2, y: 1})
  x.set(x.get() - 1)
})
```

The example outputs `x 1` and `y 2` before and `y 1` after the call to
`holding(...)`.

## About the implementation

The implementations of the concepts provided by this library have been
**optimized for space** at a fairly low level.  The good news is that you can
**use atoms and lenses with impunity**.  The bad news is that the implementation
is tightly bound to the internals of Kefir.  Should the internals change, this
library will need to be updated as well.
